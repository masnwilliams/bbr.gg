# BBR.gg | BattleBit Remastered Companion App

Welcome to the BBR.gg project repository. This project aims to develop a companion application for the popular game [BattleBit Remastered](https://joinbattlebit.com/). Our goal is to create a platform that enhances player experiences by providing valuable game analytics, news updates, and a community platform.

This companion app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React-based framework known for its efficient rendering and broad feature set.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed in your development environment.

To get the app running locally:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/masnwilliams/bbr.gg.git`
- Navigate into the cloned repository using `bbr.gg`
- Install the required dependencies using `pnpm install`

Then, you can run the development server:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Contributing

I'm still working on the contribution guidelines, but feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute to the project.

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
